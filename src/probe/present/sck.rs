//! What reached the screen of a macOS app's window, from outside (SPEC §7.2): a ScreenCaptureKit
//! stream of each of the app's windows, alone on its display (`SCContentFilter` of the display with
//! only that window, its source rectangle the window's frame). Each frame is stamped with the time it
//! was displayed (`SCStreamFrameInfoDisplayTime`, Mach absolute time: the host clock) and says which
//! parts changed (`SCStreamFrameInfoDirtyRects`). A frame that changed the app's own content is a
//! present of the app shown at that time.
//!
//! The window server redraws every window's frame by itself: on macOS 27 an idle window's rounded
//! corners and title-bar buttons were dirty 15 to 60 times a second with the app drawing nothing, a
//! desktop-independent window stream reported the whole window changed at every display refresh,
//! and a display-region stream reported damage where another app's window changed under the
//! window. So strobe streams the display region and counts a frame only when pixels of the window
//! changed in a dirty rectangle outside its corners and title-bar buttons.
//!
//! What it cannot see: when the app handed a frame over (no begin), more than one frame per display
//! refresh (the window server composites at most one), what an app draws inside those corners and
//! buttons, and anything without the Screen Recording permission. The stream asks for frames at half
//! the window's size in points: the window server scales each into that, a cost in its process and
//! strobe's, not the app's.
//!
//! Written against the Objective-C runtime and the block ABI directly (no C build, no bindings).
