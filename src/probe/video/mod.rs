//! Video of what a target showed (SPEC §8.8), for people to watch beside the numbers. Only untimed
//! blocks and `record --video` take one: every source costs CPU and GPU time in strobe, in the OS's
//! compositor or encoder, or in the target's own renderer (rule 3).
//!
//! Two kinds, never mixed in one comparison:
//!
//! - `screen`: the OS's copy of the window as it composited it: Windows.Graphics.Capture into Media
//!   Foundation's H.264 encoder (Windows, frame times on the QPC clock), a ScreenCaptureKit stream of
//!   the window into AVAssetWriter (macOS, each frame at its display time), the X server's copy of the
//!   window (`GetImage`) at 30 frames a second into ffmpeg (Linux X11).
//! - `renderer`: a Chromium page's own compositor frames (DevTools `Page.startScreencast`, JPEG), each at
//!   the time its frame was swapped, into ffmpeg at 30 frames a second: works headless and on a locked
//!   session, and is not proof that a frame reached a display.
//!
//! Every frame is stamped on the host clock, so `video.json` maps runs and inputs to media time.
