//! The clock Windows counts thread, process and idle cycle times in (SPEC §13.6), so cycles become
//! time. Since Windows 11 24H2 the kernel charges a thread the performance-counter ticks it ran times
//! one factor (Cobalt 100 VMs on 25H2: 339.92 to 339.95 per 100 ns tick; a Ryzen 9950X3D on 26300:
//! 430), so cycles over QPC × factor are exact time. Before, it charged raw cycles: the invariant TSC
//! on x64 (cycles over RDTSC are time), the core's clock cycles (PMCCNTR_EL0) on Arm, whose rate
//! follows the clock and which stop while a core idles: not time.
//!
//! Told apart once per boot, before strobe moves its own affinity (`warm`, from `app::dispatch`): a
//! thread pinned to each CPU, all at once, reads its own cycle time 1000 times, each read bracketed by
//! two QPC reads, with a varying wait between reads. A step fits when its whole tick count
//! k = round(Δcycles / factor) lies within the QPC ticks the bracket allows and Δcycles is within 1.5
//! of k × factor; the factor is seeded from Δcycles over ΔQPC on long steps, never from a rated
//! frequency, so a half or a third of it cannot fit (k would exceed the bracket). The verdict is kept
//! in `<state>/cycle-clock.json`, keyed by the boot, the OS build and strobe's build, so a later
//! invocation whose affinity leaves out CPUs reuses it.
