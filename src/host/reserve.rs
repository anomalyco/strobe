//! Keeps this user's other processes off a timed block's CPUs (SPEC §9.4, `bench --reserve-cpus`).
//! Agents, builds and editors left to the scheduler land on the CPUs strobe pinned the target to;
//! for the length of one block each of them gets a default CPU set without those CPUs, and gets its
//! own back after the block. A sweep every 200 ms catches processes started during the block (a
//! build spawning compilers): CPU sets are not inherited.
//!
//! Windows: process default CPU sets (not affinity masks): they need only
//! `PROCESS_SET_LIMITED_INFORMATION`, restore exactly (affinity changes overwrite every thread's own
//! mask, which nothing can put back), are never inherited, and on the machines checked hold as hard as
//! affinity (24 busy threads on a 16-CPU set stayed off the other CPUs). Threads that selected CPU
//! sets themselves, or set an affinity mask, keep theirs.
//!
//! Linux: thread affinity (`sched_setaffinity`, allowed on this user's processes without root): each
//! thread of a process gets its own mask without the target's CPUs, and its own mask back after the
//! block. Threads and processes a moved thread starts inherit the narrowed mask, so the sweep only
//! has to find processes started from elsewhere; what a moved process started during the block gets
//! its parent's mask back. A thread whose mask changed since (the process set its own) keeps it.
//!
//! What changes is journaled in `<state>/reserve.json` first, so a strobe killed mid-block is undone
//! by the next strobe that starts. macOS has no CPU affinity: nothing to reserve.
