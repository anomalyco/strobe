//! Many cases per launch (`--check --batch N`, SPEC §5.6): run cases one launch can hold (one target,
//! the same params, GPU cache and way of measuring) share a launch, its prepare and its setup, up to N
//! at a time. After each case's runs and reset the page or app must be back where the launch's first
//! run started (`ResetIncomplete`), still answer, show what the case expects (`WrongScreen`) and have
//! taken the OS's input where strobe put it, before the next case runs. A case that fails, crashes or
//! leaves dirty state fails alone and ends its launch: the next case gets a fresh one. One recording per
//! launch marks each case (`case:<i>:<name>:start|end`), and each case's actions name it.
