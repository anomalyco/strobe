//! OS input to a page measured from outside (SPEC §9.10, §13.6): against a native implementation or a
//! page in another engine a page gets the input the native side gets, from the OS's own posters
//! (`a11y::input`: posted window messages on Windows, Quartz events on macOS, XTest on X11), never
//! DevTools or WebDriver. Every engine the same way: elements are still found through the page probe;
//! their page point goes to the screen through a map strobe measures at the block's start, from where
//! posted pointer moves landed in the page (which also proves posted input reaches it), never from an
//! engine's own idea of where its viewport is. The map holds while the window and the page's viewport
//! stay where they were, or as a `page.window` strobe was asked for left them (the map follows that
//! size, `commanded`): checked after every run and reset (`placed`). Each kind of input is checked
//! again as the block goes: a key, button or wheel strobe posted that no trusted event in the page
//! matched refuses the block `InputMismatch` instead of timing input the page never got. Interaction
//! latency then follows the native rule (SPEC §7.4), with the page's own changes (`CHANGES_SCRIPT`: DOM
//! mutations, input and scroll events) standing in for an accessibility tree's.
