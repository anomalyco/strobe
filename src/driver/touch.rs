//! Touch input to an emulated phone's page (SPEC 13.1 "Emulated phones and touch screens", 9.6): a phone
//! is driven by a finger, never a mouse. Chromium gets touches over CDP (`Input.dispatchTouchEvent`),
//! Firefox a WebDriver pointer of type `touch` (`input.performActions`). A tap is a press (touchstart)
//! held as a finger rests, then a release (touchend); a drag and a scroll's swipes are a finger moved
//! one step per display frame, paced on strobe's clock as a mouse drag is. What a phone has no device

//! must reach the page as trusted touch and pointer events (`SCRIPT`): checked between runs, after
//! setup, at each untimed stretch's edges and before a `goto`, or the block is refused `InputMismatch`.
