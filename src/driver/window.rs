//! `page.window` sizing (SPEC §9.6): maximize, restore and resize a target's window through the OS, on
//! native apps and headed pages alike. A size is the content's (a native window's client area, a page's
//! viewport), in device-independent pixels: strobe adds the window's own part, measured as it goes (the
//! frame less the content), so a browser's toolbar or a title bar is no part of what a bench asks for.
