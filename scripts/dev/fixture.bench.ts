// Dev bench for the fixture's ownership checks (not shipped), windowless, so it runs on a locked session.
// From the repo root:
//   strobe bench scripts/dev/fixture.bench.ts --head . --check --target use    passes, connected
//   strobe bench scripts/dev/fixture.bench.ts --head . --check --target both   passes (its own server runs another program)
//   strobe bench scripts/dev/fixture.bench.ts --head . --check --target own    FixtureMismatch: no connection the fixture held
//   strobe bench scripts/dev/fixture.bench.ts --head . --check --target port   FixtureMismatch: served the fixture's port itself
// STROBE_DEV_FIXTURE=copy serves the fixture from a copy of its runtime, which the app's runtime matches byte
// for byte: `both` is then refused FixtureMismatch (a copy of the fixture's executable that serves a port),
// while `use` still passes (one program that is both the fixture and the app, serving nothing itself).
